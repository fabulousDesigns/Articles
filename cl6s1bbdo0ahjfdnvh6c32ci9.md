## Understanding Babel and How it will Help you Write JavaScript

### Introduction
When you use Babel, you can convert edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can be run in any browser, no matter where you are (even the old ones).
Classes, fat arrows, and multiline strings are among the syntactical sugar that has been added to JavaScript as a result of the introduction of the new ES6 specification.
In this instructional exercise, we will take a look at how Babel can be useful in writing JavaScript code.

### Implementation
Babel is distributed as a Node.js node module. Installation, as you might expect, is via npm:
```
$ npm install â€“ D babel-cli 
```
There are plugins for webpack, gulp, grunt, Sublime, Webstorm, and a variety of other technologies. Babel is likely to be able to integrate with any development toolchain you may be using.

### Classes
JavaScript does not have any classes. The fact that objects inherit directly from one another means that any object can be the parent (superclass) of any other object in the system.
Any function can be a constructor function, and calling it with the new keyword will result in the creation of a new object.
You may learn more about object orientation in the JavaScript for Smart People course - Object Orientation portion, which is available here.
This is all amazing and JavaScript, but it makes C# and Java devs a little nervous, which is understandable. Because they are accustomed to a higher level of rigor, ES6 introduces the class keyword. This allows us to define functions that can only be used as constructors and nothing else.
The term `class` refers to a specific cookie-cutter item that can only be used to define other objects, as we are all aware. This is an exception to the rule of prototypical inheritance. As a result, we restrict ourselves to only constructing objects from functions that we have specifically determined should be used in this manner.

#### Classes in Babel
An ES6 class resembles this:
```javascript
class Person {}
var dave = new Person
```
When we run it through Babel, we receive nothing more than a constructor function and a little extra decoration:
```javascript
"use strict";
function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {
  if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {
    throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function");
  }
}
var Person = function Person() {
  _classCallCheck(this, Person);
};
var dave = new Person();
```
The Person function, which may be used as a standard prototype constructor, is already available. With the `_classCallCheck` function, we can perform a small amount of safety checking as well.
This method is called within the Person constructor, and it will throw an error unless the Person function is treated as a constructor function, in which case it will return true.
### Multiline Strings
In addition, ES6 introduces a new, more succinct manner of defining strings. You can construct multiline strings by using the backtick symbol. Using this method is extremely beneficial when creating templates in JavaScript. Here's an example of a straightforward Angular template:
- **Example**
```javascript
var template = `
<div>
  <h1>hello {{name}}</h1>
</div>
`
```
The following is compiled:
```javascript
var template = "
  <div>
    <h1>hello {{name}}</h1>
  </div>
  ";
  ```
### Fat Arrows
The use of fat arrows allows us to define anonymous functions in a readable manner.
 we can write like this:
- **Example**
```javascript
 (x, y) => {return x + y};
```
Results to:
```javascript
(function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
});

```
 It should be noted that this function has not been invoked. If I wanted to, I could store it to a variable or provide it as an argument to a callback or a promise.
 If I wanted to invoke the function, I could do something like this: 
- **calling the function**
```javascript
(x, y) => {return x + y} (1,2);
```
Gives the following:
```javascript
(function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
})(1, 2);
```
### Fat arrows with an exactly single parameter
When we have exactly one parameter we are allowed to omit the braces preceding the arrow:
```javascript
x => {return x + 1};
```
we get:
```javascript
(function (x) {
  return x + 1;
});
```
### Fat Arrows with exactly one line of code
 There is, even more, we can do than this. If our function contains exactly one line of code (assuming a line ends with a semi-colon) we can omit the curly braces altogether:
```javascript
x => x + 1;
```
Results to:
```javascript
(function (x) {
  return x + 1;
});
```
#### Fat arrows in practice
Let's use one of these to output all the elements in an array.
```javascript
[1, 2, 99].map(num => console.log(num));
```
gives us:
```javascript
[1, 2, 99].map(function (num) {
  return console.log(num);
});

```
#### Fat Arrows and This(Lexical Scoping) 
 When a function is invoked, the `this` keyword in JavaScript is configured to return the object that is immediately preceding the dot. This is sensible, but it might be inconvenient at times because it necessitates the storage of `this` in that.
A way around `this` is to use a fat arrow, which keeps the current value of `this`. This is referred to as `lexical scoping`.
```javascript
x = {
  y: function() {
    () => {console.log(this)}();
  }
}
```
Results to:
```javascript
x = {
  y: function y() {
    var _this = this;
    (function () {
      console.log(_this);
    })();
  }
};
```
- We can see that the value of this has been stored in a variable inside the closure.
### Conclusion
A sugary layer on top of `ES5` makes up the majority of `ES6`, according to the formula. Inside, the JavaScript programming language retains its status as the prototype list processing language that we are all too familiar with. Aside from some excellent syntax, ES6 provides a transpiler that converts to a rather plain, regular JavaScript in the end. One reason for some of this sugar is to make it easier for Java/C# developers who, at first, may find prototypical inheritance difficult to understand. Fat arrows, for example, help us to write more concise and modern-looking code while also improving the functionality of JavaScript.
