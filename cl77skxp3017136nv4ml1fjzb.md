This is the WordPress format record make for this contact structure model.
It stacks the page title and content of the page made in the WordPress administrator board to show on the contact page.
Added to that, it has the contact structure HTML. The structure contains the fundamental fields name, email and that's only the tip of the iceberg. Every one of the fields is obligatory and approved utilizing JavaScript.
The approval script is in the format record. We can likewise enqueue the JavaScript resources by utilizing the WordPress center capacities `wp_enqueue_script()`.

```php
<?php
get_header();
while (have_posts()) :
    the_post();
    ?>
<article id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>

    <header class="entry-header alignwide">
            <?php
    the_title('<h1 class="entry-title">', '</h1>');
    ?>
        </header>
    <!-- .entry-header -->

    the_content('<p>', '</p>');
    ?>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
            href="/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentytwentyone-child/style.css">
        <form name="contactForm" id="contactForm" method="post"
            onsubmit="return formValidation()"  action="">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="label">Name:</div>
                <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

### Send AJAX demand utilizing wp_ajax snares

This JavaScript code has two capacities. The `formValidation()` is for approving the contact structure and the `processContactSubmit()` is to call `wp_ajax` to handle the contact structure in WordPress.
The AJAX demand passes the approved structure information to the worker side. It calls the `admin_ajax.php` with the activity boundary to snare the `wp_ajax`.

**Ajax script**

```javascript
<script>
function formValidation() {
      event.preventDefault();
      var name = document.forms["contactForm"]["name"].value;
      var email = document.forms["contactForm"]["email"].value;
      var subject = document.forms["contactForm"]["subject"].value;
      var message = document.forms["contactForm"]["message"].value;
      document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = '';
      var errorMessage="<span class='error'>All fields are required.</span>";
      var regEx = /^([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\@([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\.([A-Za-z]{2,4})$/;

         if (name.trim() == "" ||email.trim() == "" || subject.trim() == "" || message.trim() == "") {
             document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = errorMessage;
             return false;
           }
       if (!regEx.test(email)) {
           var errorMessage="<span class='error'>Invalid email.</span>";
            document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = errorMessage;
            return false;
          }
      processContactSubmit();
      return true;
    }

function processContactSubmit() {
                var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
                request.open("POST", "/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=process_contact_form");
                request.onreadystatechange = function() {
                    if(this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200) {
                        document.getElementById("status").innerHTML = this.responseText;
                    }
                };
                var myForm = document.getElementById("contactForm");
                var formData = new FormData(contactForm);
                request.send(formData);
}
</script>
```

functions.php
In functions.php, it snares the `wp_ajax` activity `process_contact_form()` on mentioning through AJAX.
It gets the structure information to set the contact email subject and the primary body content.
It additionally sets the mail header and beneficiary email address to go through the mail sending capacity.
This code utilizes the `wp_mail` to send the contact email utilizing WordPress. There are WordPress modules to empower SMTP for sending messages.

```php
<?php
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_process_contact_form', 'process_contact_form');

function process_contact_form()
{
    $to = "Recipient Email Address";
    $subject = $_POST["subject"];
    $headers = "Testing";
    $message = $_POST["message"];
    $attachments = "";
    $sent = wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers, $attachments);
    if (! $sent) {
        echo "<span class='error'>Problem in sending mail.</span>";
    } else {
        echo "<span class='success'>Hi, thank you for the message.</span>";
    }
    wp_die();
}
```
